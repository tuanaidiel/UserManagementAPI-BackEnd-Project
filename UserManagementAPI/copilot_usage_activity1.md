Project: User Management API

1. Project Setup

Used Copilot to scaffold the API in Program.cs.

Suggested the basic structure of the Controllers and Models folders.

2. Model Creation

Copilot provided a basic User model with properties such as Id, Name, and Email.

Suggested default data annotations for validation.

3. CRUD Endpoints

Copilot generated basic methods in UserController.cs, including:

GetUsers()

GetUserById(int id)

CreateUser(User user)

UpdateUser(int id, User user)

DeleteUser(int id)

Methods were refined manually to fit the project requirements.

4. Code Completion

Assisted in writing route attributes and HTTP verbs (e.g., [HttpGet], [HttpPost]).

Suggested dependency injection setup.

5. Error Handling & Debugging

Helped in resolving missing namespace errors (e.g., CS0246: Type or namespace name 'User' could not be found).

Suggested adding using UserManagementAPI.Models; to resolve model reference issues.

6. API Documentation

Suggested adding Swagger using Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package.

Provided sample XML comments for controller methods.

7. Optimization & Best Practices

Recommended improvements such as using async methods.

Suggested proper exception handling using try-catch blocks.

Summary

Copilot significantly helped in automating boilerplate code, reducing development time, and ensuring adherence to best practices. Manual refinements were made for customization and optimization.
