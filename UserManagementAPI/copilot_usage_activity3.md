Copilot Usage: Middleware Implementation and Pipeline Configuration
In this activity, I will leverage GitHub Copilot to create middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling in my User Management API. This hands-on project will enhance my understanding of middleware development, from implementation to management.

Objectives:
✅ Implement logging middleware to track requests and responses.
✅ Develop authentication middleware to validate user access.
✅ Create error handling middleware for standardized exception management.
✅ Configure the middleware pipeline for optimized performance and security.

How Copilot Can Assist Me:
🚀 Code Suggestions – Generate boilerplate middleware templates quickly.
🔍 Best Practices – Get recommendations for structuring middleware efficiently.
⚡ Debugging Support – Identify and fix potential issues in real-time.

By the end of this activity, I will have a fully functional middleware pipeline that improves observability, security, and reliability in my API. Let’s get started! 🚀
